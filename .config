#### Configuration file
#
# This file is used to configure the sorting order. It must follow
# a pretty simple pattern, like this: <Attribute>_<Direction> 
# and multiple parameters must be comma separated. 
#
# <Attribute> param must be "Title", "Author" or "Edition" 
# <Direction> param must be "ASC" for ascendant and "DSC" for descendant
# There's no case sensitivity.
#
#       Example:
#       params = edition_ASC, TITLE_dsc
